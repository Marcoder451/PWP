## Milestone 1 Feedabck
I'm really looking forward to seeing this project take shape - this is a great idea for PWP. In all likelihood, ANC's website needs will be beyond the scope of PWP in the future, but you can put together a very nice MVP based on your purpose and goals outlined here.

Your purpose, audience, goal, Persona and Use Case are all good - and your HTML is looking good overall as well. There are a couple of technical issues I want to bring to your attention, please see **Edits &amp; Suggestions** below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) - nice job. You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- line 1 in your `.gitignore` should be `.DS_Store`
- move your `/css` directory and `index.php` file inside `/public_html` - or delete them until you're ready to begin development after Milestone 2a.
- Looks like all the page content is in the &lt;header&gt; tag! **Quick fix**: Move the closing `</header>` tag up from line 66 to line 10, and you're good to go.
- Keep a close eye on your indentation - the &lt;p&gt; tags are indented one level too deep. Very minor point - but just keep your eye on it.
